## Visualisation
I came to PHD School with a problem how to visualize hundreds of modelling results

QGIS blending styles help to some extent

## Rproducibility
I used a rather small amount of raw data: 13 land use maps
I used hundreds of modelling areas, but they were generated automatically from 3 sets of basic units:
administrative, physical and geometrical spatial units

All of my code I uploaded already to my GitHUB repository
